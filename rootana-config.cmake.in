ROOTANAConfig
---------
Defines ROOTANA include dirs and libraries

Use this module by invoking find_package with the form::

  find_package(ROOTANA
    [REQUIRED]             # Fail with error if ROOTANA is not found
    )                     

This module finds headers and requested component libraries. During installation,
paths to these directories are hard-coded and results are reported in variables::

  ROOTANA_FOUND            - True if headers and requested libraries were found
  ROOTANA_PACKAGE_NAME     - ROOTANA package name
  ROOTANA_INCLUDE_DIRS     - ROOTANA include directories
  ROOTANA_LIBRARY_DIRS     - Link directories for Boost libraries
  ROOTANA_LIBRARIES        - ROOTANA component libraries to be linked
